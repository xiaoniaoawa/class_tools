Rinfo.txt is a configuration file for randomly selected student numbers. You can change the contents of the file in the classroom toolbox.py or directly (a more advanced method)
The failure to run caused by random changes can be changed back to the preset format by using the "Settings" function of the Toolbox!
Some computers (computers that flash back when executing most commands) need to grant "full control permission" to all application packages and all restricted application package users under "attribute - Security - group or user name" of "py.exe" under "C: / windows"!
It is also possible that the operation fails to meet the requirements in some links, which may lead to flash back. Just reopen the file and operate again as required
Be sure to install python3. *!!!
If it still fails to run, you can try to enter the following command in administrator CMD:
pip install readtxt
and
pip install txt
(then there is a long list of English. Don't worry about it. Just close the window when the progress bar is full. If there is no progress bar, you can close the window directly.)
also
pip install random
(then there is a long list of English. Don't worry about it. Just close the window when the progress bar is full. If there is no progress bar, you can close the window directly.)
pip install Random
(then there was a long list of English. Don't worry about it. Just close the window when the progress bar is full. If there is no progress bar, you can close the window directly.)
